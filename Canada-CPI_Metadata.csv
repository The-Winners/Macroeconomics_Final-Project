2,"The Bank of Canada's preferred measures of core inflation, CPI-common, CPI-median and CPI-trim, are subject to revision. In the case of CPI-median and CPI-trim, the revisions result from the fact that these measures are based on seasonally adjusted price index series. In the case of CPI-common, revisions are due to the statistical technique used, as the factor model is estimated over all available historical data. This table contains historical data for these three measures and is updated on a monthly basis."
3,"This measure is based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) series adjusted to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes."
4,"This measure is based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) series that have been treated to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes, and that have been seasonally adjusted."
5,"CPI-common is a measure of core inflation that tracks common price changes across categories in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket."
6,"CPI-median is a measure of core inflation corresponding to the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket weights) of the distribution of price changes in a given month."
7,"CPI-trim is a measure of core inflation that excludes Consumer Price Index (CPI) components whose rates of change in a given month are located in the tails of the distribution of price changes."
8,"This real-time table is designed to track changes in the estimates since their initial release. Typically, data are released as preliminary for a specific period, revised the following period based on new information and eventually revised in an annual or historical revision process. Additional information can be found in the <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/dai/btd/rct">Real-time CANSIM tables</a> article."
